Url of the deployed webiste: https://websitesharer-yudong.herokuapp.com/

For the creative component, I chose to display the charset of the website. It is important so that the characters on the website won't be displayed incorrectly.

Url that works on my app: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3281548/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0

As for the visual feature, I added a background color to the displaying block, so that it distinguishes from the website background.
